name: prose
description: >-
  Rewrite any text a human will review so it is quick to read, then prove the
  pass ran. Applies by default, unasked, before every commit that adds or
  changes prose — READMEs and other docs, code comments, architecture docs,
  specs, the commit message itself — and before posting a pull request
  description, review reply, or GitHub, Linear or Discord comment. Also use when
  the user says "tighten this", "this is too long", "make this readable", or
  "rewrite this for a reviewer". Commits carry a Prose: trailer; posted text
  ends with a signed prose footer.

# Prose

**A reviewer should get what they need from the text in one read.** Text that is
true but slow to read has failed.

Prose's first call prints the rules from [rules.md](rules.md), their only
copy. Work from that printout, not from memory of an earlier session.

- **Why each rule and mechanism is the way it is:** [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).
  Read it before changing this file.

## What counts as prose

Anything a human reviews: READMEs and other docs, code comments, architecture
docs, specs, commit messages, pull request descriptions, and posts to GitHub,
Linear and Discord. **Short kinds are not exempt.** Commit subjects and ticket
comments bloat too.

## When the pass runs

- **Before every commit that contains prose**, on the staged change and the
  commit message. Write the code first, then do the pass as one read of the
  finished text, then commit.
- **Before posting** any pull request description or comment.
- **On request**, over text you did not write.

## Two calls: the rules, then the signature

Each commit and each post takes two calls. The first takes the goals of that
text's reader, prints the rules and a pass token, and exits 4. You do the pass;
then the second call takes the token and signs. A token signs one text, once,
within 2 hours, and only of the kind that issued it: `check` for a commit,
`sign` for a post.

`S` below is this skill's `scripts/` directory: `~/.agents/skills/prose/scripts`,
or `~/.claude/skills/prose/scripts` if only that one is installed.

**Before a session's first file edit or post,** put the rules in front of you:

```sh
python3 $S/prose.py start --goals "review the fix; check it is safe to merge"
```

`--goals` lists the most probable reasons a reader opens this text, most
probable first. `start` prints the goals and the rules and signs nothing. In
Claude Code, until `start` or one of the first calls below has run in the
session, a hook blocks the session's first file write and its first `gh` or
GitHub MCP post.

**Before a commit**, stage the change, write the final message to a file, and
run the first call:

```sh
python3 $S/prose.py check -F msg.txt --goals "review the fix; check it is safe to merge"
```

It prints:

- the goals, echoed back;
- the prose in the change (Markdown, specs, the comments the diff touches, the
  message);
- history-language flags in those comments, as warnings;
- the rules: the pass, rules 1 to 7 in full, the rest as a checklist, and how
  agents cheat on the pass;
- the pass token, and the command to run next.

In a repository with a pre-commit hook, each `check` call runs it first, so a
formatter rewrites the staged files before you read them and before they are
signed. If the hook fails, the call stops with its reason; fix that, restage,
and run the call again.

Do the pass over each listed item and restage. Then run that command on the
final text, with the token:

```sh
python3 $S/prose.py check -F msg.txt --pass <token>
```

It prints only the result block, holding the trailer for this commit:

```text
=== prose result ===
Prose: ✓ 4d593e935186:9138830a72a2
=== prose open decisions: 0 ===
=== end prose ===
```

## Committing

Every commit carries `Prose: ✓ <tree>:<message>`, because every commit has a
message a reviewer reads. The two hashes bind it to the staged files and the
final message as they were when the signing `prose check` ran.

Commit through the shared commit script, with nothing staged or edited
between the signing call and the commit. Pass the block's `Prose:` value (the text
after `Prose: `) with `--verified-value`, and the message as the file you signed,
`msg.txt`, with `--message-file`:

```sh
C=$S/../../../lib/commit-trailer/commit-with-trailers.sh
$C --verified-value $S/verify-staged.sh Prose "✓ 4d593e935186:9138830a72a2" \
   --co-authored-by "<co-author>" --message-file msg.txt --
```

The file keeps the message off the command line, so it never needs quoting:
apostrophes, quotes and `$` in it are safe. Its first line is the subject, the
next line must be blank, and the rest is the body. Passing the message as two
words instead, `-- "<subject>" "<body>"`, still works.

Just before it commits, the script runs `verify-staged.sh`, which refuses the
commit if the staged files or the message no longer match the trailer. If it
refuses, run both calls again and pass the new value.

**When bug-hunter is installed,** the same commit carries bug-hunter's trailer
too ([the rule](../../lib/commit-trailer/DECISIONS.md#every-installed-skills-trailer-on-one-commit)).
While bug-hunter is running, its commit step runs the two calls above and
passes the `Prose:` value to its script: let it commit, once, with both
trailers. When you commit yourself, pass both in one command; bug-hunter's
uses `--minted-by` with its own minter:

```sh
$C --minted-by ~/.agents/skills/bug-hunter/scripts/mint-trailer.sh Bug-hunter "1 iteration, 1 bug fixed" \
   --verified-value $S/verify-staged.sh Prose "✓ 4d593e935186:9138830a72a2" \
   --co-authored-by "<co-author>" --message-file msg.txt --
```

**To amend,** run both calls with `--amend`, so the first lists the change
against the commit's parent; the trailer is the same either way. The commit
script cannot amend, so pass the block's whole `Prose:` line to git:

```sh
git commit --amend -F msg.txt --trailer "<the Prose: line>"
```

**When the hook reports a commit,** it names the commit and the reason:

- no `Prose:` trailer, or one that is not `✓ <tree>:<message>`: the pass did
  not run through `prose check`;
- `mismatch:`: the message changed after the check;
- `tree:`: the staged files changed after the check.

Run the pass and both calls again, and ask before rewriting a pushed commit.

## Posting

Posted text ends with a signed footer, such as `prose ✓ 3f2a91`, which a hook
checks before the post goes out. Post only text that went through `sign`,
exactly as `sign` printed it. The first call prints the rules and the token on stderr, and nothing on stdout:

```sh
python3 $S/prose.py sign --goals "approve the change"
python3 $S/prose.py sign --pass <token> < body.md > signed.md
gh pr create --title "..." --body-file signed.md
```

Run `gh` as the whole command, with the body as `--body-file <file>` or
`--body '<text>'`; a heredoc is not accepted. A hook blocks any other shape of
`gh` post, and any post whose footer does not match. It also blocks a command
that only mentions a `gh` post; [README.md](README.md#posting-through-gh) says
how to run one. Any edit after signing breaks the footer; sign again after
editing.

## Never

- Skip the pass because the text is short.
- Type a trailer or footer by hand. It is valid only when a script produces
  it.
- Run the signing call before the pass is done. The rules are printed for the
  rewrite between the two calls.
