## Decisions

### Decided by Adam (2026-10-19)

Decisions 1 to 10 are recorded in the body of
[igor #211](https://github.com/adamstallard/igor/issues/211). Adam gave the
others on the same day, and this proposal is the first place they are
written down: 11 to 15 and 31 in Claude Code sessions, and 32 to 35 and 38
to 41 while reviewing this pull request,
[#25](https://github.com/adamstallard/shared-skills/pull/25).

1. **Four filters run before any question reaches a person.**
   1. **Already answered:** the agent finds the earlier answer, cites where it
      is recorded, and does not ask. The earlier answer may be in another
      spec or another decision document: a decision record, a `DECISIONS.md`
      file, the decision block at the top of an issue, or a lore entry.
   2. **Deferrable:** the agent defers it without asking. The deferral stays
      visible: it is listed as not in this change, and filed as an issue if it
      outlives the change. A person who wants it now says so.
   3. **Not a real question:** unless at least two options each have merit,
      the agent takes the one it recommends and records it in a spec or
      decision document, without asking.
   4. **Cheap to reverse:** where two options have merit but switching later
      is cheap, the agent decides and records it, without asking.
2. **Every answer is recorded where the next agent will look.** Every question
   asked is logged, pointing to where its answer is recorded, so an agent
   using the inquisitor finds the answer instead of asking again. Adam's
   decisions 32 and 34 make two exceptions: a question about one person's
   way of working gets no log, and a question in one of 34's categories is
   recorded by hash only. Decision 36, which still waits for him, would add a
   third: a question about an organization with no lore repository
   configured would not be logged.
3. **An answer that generalizes becomes lore.** Where a person's answer, or a
   lesson learned from a person, is broadly useful, it is proposed as a lore
   entry: a pull request to the team's lore repository.
4. **It covers any agent about to ask a person,** not only spec review or
   OpenSpec.
5. **A hook enforces it.** A hook on Claude Code's question picker
   (`AskUserQuestion`) makes an agent run the inquisitor before asking.
6. **It vets questions in posts too.** Questions in the pull request
   descriptions, comments and chat messages an agent is about to post pass
   the same filters. The inquisitor prepares each question that survives, and
   decides who to tag in it.
7. **It takes over the questions behind handed-back items:** items an Igor
   (one of the igor project's AI teammates) hands back because of a question
   it could not settle. This and decisions 9 and 10 belong to the Igor
   inquisitor role, an Igor that brings questions to a team discussion,
   which is out of scope here.
8. **It is restrained.** It batches related questions into one post, and
   keeps to a budget of posts per channel. The budget belongs to the role.
9. **A blocked Igor filters its own question, and the inquisitor role asks
   it.** The role's half is out of scope; the filters it runs are this skill's.
10. **A question reaches the inquisitor role through the blocked item
    itself.** Out of scope.
11. **The skill is useful locally, before any Igor role exists.** It needs
    nothing from Igor.
12. **Filter 1 also searches the team's lore repository**, the markdown
    entries with conditions, so lessons reach plain Claude Code sessions.
13. **Each "that was obvious" from a person is logged as a miss** against the
    filter that should have caught the question. The misses later inform
    edits to the skill, by pull request, never automatically.
14. **A lesson from the misses lands by its scope.** A lesson that holds for
    anyone using the skill is a pull request changing the skill in
    shared-skills. One that holds for one team or organization is a pull
    request to that team's lore repository. One that holds for one person goes
    to that person's own memory or `CLAUDE.md`. The question and miss logs
    stay with the repositories and lore repositories they concern (decision
    32), because they can hold private content, so a pull request to
    shared-skills carries only the generalized lesson.
15. **A skill's `DECISIONS.md` is its current reasoning in one place, not a
    log.** While a change is open, its reasoning lives in its proposal and
    design.md. When the change is archived, its lasting reasoning is folded
    into the `DECISIONS.md` of each skill it affects, rewriting the reasoning
    it supersedes rather than appending. This pull request's first commit
    puts the rule in `AGENTS.md`, and makes it the last task
    `openspec/config.yaml` asks of every change.

Decisions 31 to 35 came after decisions 16 to 30 below were numbered, so they
take the next free numbers. 32 to 35 came from Adam's review of #25, and
replace what decisions 18 and 19 said about where questions are logged:

31. **When no candidate in the tagging order can decide, the inquisitor's
    script tags the person running the session, or no one.** When the
    inquisitor vets a question in a post and none of the candidates its
    tagging order finds has write access to the repository the question
    concerns, the script tags the person running the session, if that person
    has write access. Otherwise it posts the question with no tag, and the
    post says that no one with authority to decide could be found. The
    tagging order is decision 17's, which still waits for Adam; decision 31
    holds for whatever order he settles on, and does not approve 17's.
    Decision 41 says how the person running the session is identified, and
    when they are asked in the session instead of tagged.
32. **No personal question log.** Every question concerns a project, an
    organization or a repository, and a question that concerns none of them
    is not asked. Each question's record goes with what it concerns, at that
    place's privacy, which its maintainers decide. No question log is kept
    under the person's home directory, or anywhere else personal. The one
    exception is a question about one person's way of working, such as "should I keep working while you're
    away?": its answer goes into that person's memory or `CLAUDE.md`, which
    agents already read, and it gets no log.
33. **Recontextualise or don't ask.** A question is about one thing, a
    repository, a project or an organization, and is written at that thing's
    privacy. Context from something more private is generalised ("because
    some private backend might do Y", not "because gmango's backend does Y")
    or left out. If the question can't stand without that context, it is not
    asked. A question is never filed in a more private place to keep its
    context.
34. **Some questions are asked but never logged in readable form:** one
    about an unfixed security vulnerability (such as whether a path
    traversal is exploitable), one holding a secret (a key or token), and
    one holding personal information about someone (their health, an HR
    matter, a conflict between people). The filters still run, and the agent
    may still ask. The picker hook matches a question's exact text against its
    latest verdict (decision 22), so the script still records a verdict for
    such a question, but only as a hash of its text, the verdict, the time,
    and a category from a fixed list: `vulnerability`, `secret` or
    `personal`. No text, context or answer is recorded. The fixed list keeps
    "don't log this" from becoming a way to skip the record: the agent must
    name why the question is not logged. A vulnerability's answer goes to the
    fix and to the repository's private security advisory, which is its
    lasting record. Decision 38 says how long the hash record is kept.
35. **A team's lore repository has a `questions/` area** for questions about
    the organization or project that are not important enough to become lore
    but are worth keeping so that nobody asks them again. It sits outside
    the lore entries, so nothing in it is given to agents as lore, and it has
    the lore's privacy and access, which its maintainers set. Filter 1
    searches both the lore entries and `questions/`. Promoting an answer from
    `questions/` to lore is a pull request in the same repository. A question
    about one repository stays in that repository's `.inquisitor/questions/`.

Adam gave 38 to 41 after decisions 36 and 37 below were numbered, answering
four questions that spec-check's consistency read raised:

38. **Every hook record expires after 2 hours.** A record of a verdict, with
    a category or without one, is the hooks' state: it is kept 2 hours, the
    time in which a hook reads it, and then deleted. Nothing keeps a lasting
    record of a question in one of decision 34's categories. Kept on the
    person's machine, it would be a personal log, which decision 32 rules
    out. Kept in a `questions/` area, it would show, in a public repository,
    that such a question was asked and when.
39. **A question in one of decision 34's categories is asked only through
    the picker,** or, for a vulnerability, in the repository's private
    security advisory. The post hook blocks a post that holds one.
40. **An Igor's handback comment is outside this change.** The comment an
    Igor posts when it hands an item back is governed by igor #211, whose
    decision 9 says nothing posts it to a discussion, batches it or tags
    anyone. The post hook, batching and tagging do not apply to it. The Igor
    inquisitor role is out of scope here.
41. **The person running the session is the GitHub login in the
    inquisitor's configuration,** `~/.config/shared-skills/inquisitor.json`
    (decision 25), not the login `gh api user` returns: an agent posting as
    a GitHub App has no user, and one posting as the person would tag
    itself. When the post would go out as that same login, the agent asks
    the person through the picker in the session instead of tagging them,
    since a self-tag sends no notification. When no login is configured, it
    also asks through the picker.

### For Adam to confirm

Decisions 16 to 18 are #211's proposals that apply to the skill; #211's
other proposals concern the role. Decisions 19 to 30, 36 and 37 were needed
to write the requirements. Adam confirmed 19, 21 and 27 on 2026-10-19, and
each is marked so. His decision 32 later replaced part of 19, and his
decision 35 part of 18.
The others here still wait for him.

16. **A prepared question** states the recommended answer, what changes under
    the other answer, and a link to any related earlier decision, so that most
    can be answered "yes". In the picker the recommendation is the first
    option, and the hook checks it.
17. **Who is tagged in a post:** one person who can decide, where #211
    proposed the fewest who can. Only a person with write access to the
    repository the question concerns can decide it. Among them, the script
    tags the first it finds
    of: whoever approved the related earlier decision, a reviewer listed in
    that repository's `.inquisitor/reviewers`, then whoever last changed the
    files involved. #211 named "a reviewer or expert named in the team's
    configuration"; a file in the repository is that configuration, so
    every teammate's agent tags the same person. A person whose access can't
    be read counts as having none. When no candidate has write access,
    decision 31 says who is tagged; Adam has already decided it.
18. **An answer about one repository lives in that repository.** This half
    of #211's proposal still waits for Adam. His decision 35 settled the
    other half, an answer that spans repositories: it goes to the team's
    lore repository's `questions/`, or into lore itself when it is important
    enough.
19. **Confirmed by Adam (2026-10-19), and amended by his decision 32.** **The
    log is one file per question,** under `.inquisitor/questions/` at the
    root of the repository the question concerns, committed with the work.
    A question about an organization or project goes to its lore
    repository's `questions/` instead (decision 35). Each file's name has a
    random suffix, so two branches that each log a question never write the
    same file. *Rejected:* one log file that every question appends to,
    because two branches that each log a question then conflict when they
    merge.
20. **Only an answer with authority stops a question.** An answer is a
    decision document in the repository, an issue's decision block written
    by someone with write access, a logged answer from such a person, or an
    `active` lore entry scoped to everyone or to this repository. Everything
    else, including `provisional` and `deprecated` entries, is shown as
    input. An answer in the picker is the decision of the person running the
    session.
21. **Confirmed by Adam (2026-10-19).** **An agent asks a person only
    through the picker,** where the host has one, so that the hook sees
    every question. On a host with no picker, this decision does not apply,
    and no hook checks the question. *Rejected:* a hook at the end of the
    agent's turn that reads questions in its reply, because the person has
    already read the reply when that hook runs.
22. **Two calls prove the filters ran,** as prose's two calls prove its pass
    ran. The first prints the filters, runs filter 1's search and issues a
    token. The second records a verdict for each question. The hook allows a
    question only if the latest verdict on its text is "ask" and less than 2
    hours old, and fails open when it can't read its input. *Rejected:* a
    signed footer inside the question, because the person reads it in the
    picker. See design.md.
23. **The spec defines a question in a post** (*Questions in posts pass the
    same filters*). This settles #211's first open question, how to find the
    questions in a post's free text, by filter 4: the rule lives in one
    function, so changing it later is cheap. A post is
    vetted after prose's pass and before prose signs it.
24. **The post hook reads `gh` and GitHub MCP posts through the same code as
    prose's posting hook,** moved into `.agents/lib/gh-post/`. *Rejected:* a
    copy of that code, since prose's parser had about 25 places where it
    misread commands before it was cut to an allow-list. Also rejected:
    calling prose's copy, which would fail whenever prose is not installed.
    The hook covers GitHub only, as prose's does. A question in a Linear or
    Discord post is covered by the skill's instructions alone.
25. **Lore repositories are named in `~/.config/shared-skills/inquisitor.json`**
    as local clones, each with the GitHub owners it serves.
26. **Lessons are drafted from the misses only when a person asks** to review
    them, and the script refuses a lesson for shared-skills that quotes a
    logged question.
27. **Confirmed by Adam (2026-10-19).** **The skill opens a lore pull
    request without asking first,** as a `provisional` entry, and reports
    its link: a pull request is itself a proposal, and closing it is cheap.
    The skill's script refuses to open one to a public lore repository when
    the answer came from a private repository.
28. **The hooks are enabled by default,** as prose's blocking hooks are.
    Installing the skill is the opt-in.
29. **A scenario about what the agent does is traced to a test that checks
    SKILL.md states the rule.** spec-trace's CI fails on an untagged scenario
    once the change is archived. *Rejected:* exempting those scenarios in
    spec-trace's baseline (`openspec/spec-trace-baseline.txt`), which takes
    no new lines.
30. **OpenSpec is used for new work in shared-skills.** A skill's spec holds
    what must be true of it, and its `DECISIONS.md` holds why. Existing skills
    get no spec until a change touches them. This pull request adopts OpenSpec,
    spec-check's decisions-first rule and spec-trace for the repository.

Decision 36 came after Adam's 32 to 35, from writing 35's requirements:

36. **A question's file reaches a lore repository's `questions/` by a pull
    request,** opened without asking first, as decision 27's lore pull
    requests are, since the current work's commits can't carry a file into
    another repository. Where no lore repository is configured for the owner of the
    repository the question concerns, the question is not logged, and the
    agent tells the person so.

Decision 37 came from spec-check's consistency read of 32 to 36:

37. **The hooks' records live in
    `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/inquisitor/`,** as prose's
    session marks do, because a session spans repositories and the hook's
    working directory can differ from the one the script ran in. They hold
    hashes, verdicts, fields and times, never a question's text, and each is
    deleted 2 hours after it was made, with a category or without one
    (Adam's decision 38). So they are the hooks' state and not the question
    log decision 32 rules out.
    *Rejected:* the repository's git directory, where a run in another
    repository would leave records the hook never reads. See design.md.

**Still open:**

Four facts are unmeasured. Tasks 0.1 to 0.3 measure the first, including
the shape of the hook's input; tasks 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6 measure the others.

- **Can a `PreToolUse` hook block `AskUserQuestion`?** If not, the picker is
  covered by the skill's instructions alone, and the README says so.
- **Can an agent without push access read another person's permission on a
  repository?** If not, wherever the agent lacks push access, every answer
  in a post and every issue's decision block counts as input, and a post's
  question tags no one.
- **Can the script find the GitHub login of the last person to commit to a
  file?** Git records a name and an email, not a login. If not, the third
  candidate in decision 17's order is skipped.
- **Can the post hook tell an Igor's handback comment from other posts?**
  Igor's own code might post it outside any tool call, where no hook sees
  it, or an agent might post it with `gh`. If the hook can't tell, it would
  block an unvetted question in such a comment, against decision 40, until
  the Igor inquisitor role's work marks the comment.

#211's other open questions: decision 23 settles the first. The other two,
how long to wait before following up and whether a discussion is a new kind
of surface for Igor, concern the role only.

## Why

Agents ask people too many questions. Many were already answered, could wait,
have one sensible answer, or are cheap to undo, yet each costs the reviewer
time, and review is often the slowest step in the work. A question answered in
one person's private session is also lost to the rest of the team, so another
agent asks it again.

## What Changes

- A new skill, `inquisitor`, runs every question an agent is about to put to
  a person through four filters, and lets through only those a person must
  answer.
- The questions that survive are prepared for a quick answer, batched, and
  asked through the picker or in a post. Each one asked is logged with where
  its answer is recorded, in the repository or the team's lore repository it
  concerns, so the next agent finds the answer instead of asking.
- A hook blocks a question in the picker, or in a GitHub post, that has not
  been through the filters.
- A person's "that was obvious" is logged as a miss. Reviewing the misses
  produces lessons, each sent where it applies: the skill, a team's lore, or
  one person's memory.
- shared-skills adopts OpenSpec, with spec-check's decisions-first rule and
  spec-trace's CI check.

**Out of scope:** the Igor inquisitor role (#211: decisions 7, 9 and 10, and
the per-channel budget in decision 8), which brings surviving questions to a
team discussion.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

- `inquisitor`: filtering, preparing, asking and logging the questions an
  agent puts to a person, and learning from the questions that should not
  have been asked.

### Modified Capabilities

None.

## Impact

- New: `.agents/skills/inquisitor/` with its scripts, hooks and tests.
- prose: its posting hook's command reader moves to `.agents/lib/gh-post/`,
  unchanged in behaviour, so the inquisitor's post hook reads posts the same
  way.
- In each repository where it runs, the skill writes `.inquisitor/`. In a
  team's lore repository, it opens pull requests that add to `questions/`.
- The README's skills table, and its list of skills that turn on a hook.
- This pull request's first commit adds `openspec/`, `AGENTS.md` and
  spec-trace's CI workflow to shared-skills.
